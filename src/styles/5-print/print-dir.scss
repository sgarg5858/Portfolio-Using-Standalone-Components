// The other file I sometimes like to include is the print.scss stylesheet 
// that covers any custom print styling of your site. 
// This is especially helpful on very animated or colorful websites that contain technical
// documentation â€” you might want to include styles that simplify things, and possibly omit 
// elements for printing for easier content digesting.

//  You could easily put this in your base folder, but I like keeping it separate as 
//  it often modifies content significantly different than intended for the overall 
//  application when used in its natural format (digital device).
