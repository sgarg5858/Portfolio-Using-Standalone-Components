// Helpers is where some of the most important things are. 
// The first thing youâ€™ll need is your constants. 
// This stylesheet contains all of the variables for your colors, 
// font-families, z-indexes, and some default sizing. 
// For example, I like to add $border-radius-large and $border-radius-small 
// variables to help keep that aspect consistent throughout the app.
